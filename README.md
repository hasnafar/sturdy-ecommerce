# sturdy-ecommerce

## Description
Using Express.js and MySQL, I built the back end of an e-commerce site. When a user inputs database name and MySQL username and password into a .env file, Sequelize connects to a database. When the user enters schema and seed commands, a development database is created and seeded. When a user opens API GET routes in Insomnia, data for categoies, products, and tags is displayed.
